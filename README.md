The main aim of this repository(mysql_projects) is to analyze data using MYSQL. The datasets are csv files from Kaggle.
The datasets end with .csv(eg insurance.csv)
The projects end with .sql(eg insurance Data Analysis.sql)
The guide questions used for the data analysis are well numbered in the projects.
You are all welcome to take a look at my projects.
